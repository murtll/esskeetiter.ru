        My name is <a href="https://github.com/murtll">@murtll</a> and currently I am working in <a href="https://onetwotrip.com">OneTwoTrip</a> as Junior DevOps Engineer.
        <br/>
        However, I am also interesed in many other IT areas, such as backend development and CLI/TUI utilities for Linux systems.
        <br/>
        Also I am working on some personal projects (such as <a href="https://mcbrawl.ru">mcbrawl.ru</a>), where I am trying to master some new for me technologies.
